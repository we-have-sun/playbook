# Style Guide

We write code in a consistent style that emphasizes cleanliness and team communication. There is programming and good programming, [Clean Code]() has given us much knowledge on what are the best practices and how to actually write good and elegant code.

High-level guidelines:

- Be consistent and focused.
- Explicit naming.
- No duplication.
- Clean code is taken care of.
- Comment only when necessary.

Our projects have [ESlint](https://eslint.org/) integrated with [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and CSS is verified by [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) which helps us stick to our high-level guidelines and keep our reviews focused on code legibility & quality.
