# Project Handoff

When a project ends, here comes the time to handoff the work that was done to our client or client's team. It's paramount to set the goals for the transition and manage the expectations, giving all the assistance needed to accomplish a smooth handoff. As a requirement, all outstanding payments for the respective project should be settled before we start the handoff.

We schedule a meeting with the client to align the process and what activities should happen during the transition period. Based on the project composition, we transfer the code, documentation, and we provide support during the setup and configuration of the project.

Since we have continuous deliveries and validations from the client in each Sprint, the handoff process is scheduled to be short (maximum of 2 days), as we expect that everyone is in the same page about what knowledge needs to be transferred.
