# Performance Monitoring

We use [Status Cake](https://www.statuscake.com/) to monitor production applications response time, and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) to audit web pages in both desktop and mobile interfaces.

Debugging performance might be the best part of a developer's job. There's a clear, numeric problem. When we fix it, that number improves. We can say things like "We made this 175% better."

There are many established techniques for fixing performance problems:

- CSS/JS Minification
- Image Optimization
- Understanding Critical CSS
- HTTP Caching
- Gzip Compression
- Eager Loading
- Database Indexing
- SQL query caching
