# Hosting

The cloud promises lower operating costs, especially at the beginning when capacity can be lower. Forget about sunk costs of expensive servers.

The cloud and the services it enables will empower our clients' businesses to start and operate in a manner that has never been possible before without significant upfront investment.

We use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com) and [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com) to host our products and websites. For Domain Names, we analyze the name on [Domainr](https://domainr.com/) to see what's available and buy it. If you already have a domain registered elsewhere, we're available to manage it.
