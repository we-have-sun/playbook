# Our Technology Stack

## JavaScript

Our current stack is based on the latest versions of JavaScript (ES6/ES7). We transpile ES6/ES7 code using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) via [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/).

## Node.js

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) enables building fast, real-time, scalable network applications, as it’s capable of handling a vast number of simultaneous connections with high throughput, consequently providing high scalability.

## React

[React](https://reactjs.org/) is our top choice for building the best client-side experience on a single-page application. React makes complex interfaces easy with small, reusable components, consistent behavior, and productive interactions. With [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), managing state in a React application is more robust, stable and mature. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform an application from a total mess of a confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern Javascript powerhouse. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) comes as the React framework for Server-Side rendering with an opinionated setup for SEO-friendly websites. It’s fast, ready for production, and ZEIT’s great team is behind it!

## HTML5/CSS3

CSS has a very powerful syntax but can quickly become very tedious when working on non-trivial projects with UI components in React. In recent years the need to solve this problem has brought to life the concept of CSS-in-JS. For this we use [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/) in order to build CSS styles coupled with each UI component.

## React Native

[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) was created by Facebook, and it is a JavaScript framework for building user interfaces with code sharing across iOS and Android platforms. It's not a write once run anywhere framework, but it helps to reduce costs of development drastically with a faster time to market. React Native outputs components that run as native views, and it enables to bridge native code (iOS and/or Android) when needed in order to build specific native features.
