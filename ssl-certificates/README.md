# SSL Certificates

We want to ensure that our user's data is encrypted during transit and that the data they may provide is sent securely. [The HTTPS-Only Standard](https://https.cio.gov/everything/) provides a great, and much more detailed, description of the reasoning behind this.

This has become much easier with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), which provides a free to use, automatic and secure certificate authority.
